                            After graduating from Metro State University in Business Administration, I've been working in the airline industry with Delta Air Lines and traveling the world. I've also worked in case management where I would look over cases for FMLA. I've decided to be a software developer after the success I've seen from my cousins and friends.

                           4 years after school, I've decided it was time for me to enter the software development world with the way technology all around us it was a no-brainer and I finally decided to learned how to code. Now a student at the University of Minnesota, I hope to gain practical experience and skills to become a pro developer.
