                    After graduating from Metro State University in Business Administration, I've been working in the
                    airline industry with Delta Air Lines and traveling the world. I've also worked in case management
                    where I would look over cases for FMLA. I've decided to be a software developer after the success
                    I've seen from my cousins and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 7 years in the finance industry it was time for me to finally consider his words. With
                    technology all around us it was a no-brainer and I finally decided to learned how to code. Now a
                    student at Thinkful, I hope to gain practical experience and skills to become a pro developer.
